# 🚀 5 Simple HTML, CSS, and JS Projects

This repository contains a collection of five simple, practical front-end projects designed for learning and showcasing basic web development skills using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.
/
## 📁 Project Breakdown

The projects included in this collection are:

1.  **Amazon Homepage Clone (`Amazon.html`)**:
    * A static clone of an Amazon product listing or homepage section, focused on HTML structure and CSS layout (including Flexbox and Grid, potentially).
2.  **Basic Calculator (`Calculator.html`)**:
    * A functional calculator application that handles basic arithmetic operations using JavaScript logic.
3.  **To-Do List App (`PlanDesign.html`)**:
    * A simple task manager that allows users to add, manage, and potentially delete tasks (and may use local storage, based on the snippet).
4.  **Odd & Even Checker (`o or e.html`)**:
    * A utility application where a user enters a number, and the program determines whether it is Odd or Even using basic JavaScript conditional logic.
5.  **StopWatch App (`StopWatch App.html`)**:
    * A functional stopwatch with Start, Stop, and Reset buttons, utilizing JavaScript `setInterval` for accurate time tracking.

## 🛠️ How to Access and Run the Code

To properly view and run these projects on your local machine, please follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
* A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports web files, such as **VS Code**.

### Setup and Viewing

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/5-Simple-HTML-CSS-JS-Projects.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/5-Simple-HTML-CSS-JS-Projects.git)
    cd 5-Simple-HTML-CSS-JS-Projects
    ```
2.  **Open the Project Folder:**
    * To properly view and modify the code, you should open the entire project folder directly with an IDE like **VS Code** or another compatible code editor.
3.  **Run the Applications:**
    * Each project is contained within a single HTML file. To run a project, simply **double-click** the respective HTML file (e.g., `Calculator.html` or `StopWatch App.html`) in your file explorer. It will automatically open in your default web browser.

> **⚠️ Important Note on Assets:**
> If any of the projects (like the Amazon clone) rely on external files such as **images** or separate **CSS/JS** files, ensure that the folder containing those assets (e.g., the **`images`** folder) **must be present alongside the HTML file** in the same directory. This is critical to prevent broken links and ensure all visual assets load correctly.
